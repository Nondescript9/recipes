Ingredients:

 - 1/4 kilo tripe, or tuwalya, cut into squares, rinsed, scrubbed well with salt
 - 1 tablespoon vinegar
 - 1/4 cup cooking oil
 - 1 teaspoon atsuete seeds
 - 1 medium red onion, peeled, chopped
 - 3 cloves garlic, peeled, chopped
 - 1/2 kilo beef shanks, or pork shanks, cut 1-inch thick
 - 1 bunch string beans, cut into 3-inch lengths
 - 2 eggplants, cut into wedges
 - 2 bunches pechay, separated
 - 1/2 cup peanuts, pounded into a paste
 - 1/4 cup rice, toasted, pounded into a powder
 - bagoong, to serve

Directions:

 1. In a pressure cooker over medium heat, add tripe, vinegar, and enough water to cover.
    Bring to a boil. Boil 10 minutes, discard water, and refill. Boil again, cover, and
    lock lid. Simmer until tripe is tender, about 40 minutes. Discard water, and set tripe
    aside.

 2. Meanwhile, in a pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add atsuete. Cook, stirring occasionally,
    to release its color. Use a slotted spoon to remove and discard seeds. Add onion; cook
    until softened. Add garlic; cook until fragrant.

 3. Transfer mixture to pressure cooker. Add pork shanks and tripe. Pour in enough water to
    cover. Bring to a boil, then simmer. Remove and discard any scum that rises to the surface.
    Cover, and lock lid. Cook until softened, about 30 minutes.

 4. Release pressure then unlock lid. Add string beans, eggplants, and pechay. Mix peanut paste
    and toasted rice powder together. Add to pot, and stir in. Simmer, and let thicken. Serve
    with bagoong on the side.
